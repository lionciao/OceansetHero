Samples in 2020 will be taken directly across from 46LSW in middle of lake in approx 8 meters or 24 feet of water. On same date as above a sample was taken on east end of Kip several yards past all cabins with identical data results except secchi depth a little better at 2.1 m in approx same depth of water. This is interesting as later in season the east end has less visibility due to algae as water flow is easterly to the river outlet.,,,,,,,,

The wind speed was around 50 km/h, so the water was very cloudy. The water level is quite a bit lower than when I last observed it. There are lots of mud cracks present where the water used to be. There’s also quite a bit of white evaporate where the water used to be. The mud cracks and white evaporate are shown in the pictures attached.",,,,,,,,
